This is an algorithm I created to test for all the possible outcomes of a system I developed to create the stats of an RPG character based on a simple BuzzFeed style quiz set created by the Game Master before a campaign or session.

The results confirmed my hypothesis that all of the proposed possible outcomes were viable based on the test set.
